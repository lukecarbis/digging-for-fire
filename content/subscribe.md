There are 4 ways you can stay up to date with posts on Digging for Fire.

---

### RSS

Good 'ol RSS. Here's the [Site Feed](/posts/index.xml). Or, if you prefer:

<input type="text" value="https://diggingforfire.blog/posts/index.xml" readonly="readonly" style="width: 18rem; user-select: all;" />

---

### Email

Okay, I get it. RSS isn't for everyone. If you'd prefer an email to arrive in your inbox each time I publish a new post, then you can [subscribe here](https://buttondown.com/saadia).

---

### Bookmark

RSS is great and all, but you miss out on the *visuals* of the websites you like. Bloggers put so much time and effort into making their site *look good*, but their subscribers never get to see it! In that case, please consider bookmarking this site! Press Cmd+D from the homepage, or if you have your browser's favourites bar open, drag this link into it: [DfF](https://diggingforfire.blog/)
