### Bookmark

RSS is great and all, but you miss out on the *visuals* of the websites you like. Bloggers put so much time and effort into making their site *look good*, but their subscribers never get to see it! In that case, please consider bookmarking this site! Press Cmd+D from the homepage, or if you have your browser's favourites bar open, drag this link into it: [DfF](https://diggingforfire.blog/)
