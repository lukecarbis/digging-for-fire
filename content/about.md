title: What is “Digging for Fire”?
---

I started blogging _way_ back, around 2002, in a public high-school journal which I named _Digging for Fire_ (after the Pixies song).

I co-wrote a custom CMS in PHP with a friend (a Canadian I met online, who went by the moniker [Motekye](https://motekye.livejournal.com)), and we pioneered the concept of recording ourselves reading each post, and having it available as audio alongside the written words (this was available as an RSS feed – so, an early podcast?).

I’ve still got the files. It’s all very angsty. Apparently my peers loved reading about my various high-school romances and general discontent.

All these years later, I’ve kept writing in one form or another. One blog here, another there, and a career in WordPress to keep it all straight. I’ve given up on cataloguing the content or worrying about availability. It’s all in my backups, and that’s good enough for me.

So here’s a new blog, the latest in a series, and a return to where it all began. I’m not lookin’ for the mother lode. I’m diggin’ for fire.
