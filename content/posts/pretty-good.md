I’m excited to announce [_Pretty Good Podcasts_](https://prettygood.fm), a podcast network I’ve founded alongside Joshua and Jonathan Wold.

The network right now is no more than a website which lists our podcasts. Our goal is to grow the list, grow an audience, and cross promote our shows. 

The website is pretty good, too. I hand coded it in HTML and CSS. No dependencies. No build. No AI. Took about 3 hours. Had a lot of fun doing it too!

The range of shows is somehow both diverse and also… of a kind. I don’t know quite how to describe that. They seem to fit a theme, but I’m not sure which one.

[Friend of the Show](https://friendoftheshow.net) has only one episode. [Async](https://async.fm) has just published episode 100! [Crossword](https://crossword.fm) has recorded 9 seasons over 5 years.

You can hear me on Crossword, Async, and Pirate School. If you already subscribe to one Pretty Good podcast, you might enjoy some of the others too.
