Say something profound
Say something profound
Say something profound
Say something profound
Pull it down from the heavens
Pull it up from the ground
Say something,
Say something profound

Say something oblique
Say something oblique
Some obscure reference
Something antique
The less that they get it
The better it sounds
Say something obscure and profound

Say something brand new
Say something unique
An utterance that I’ll decode in a week
Say something brand new
And say something blue
With tongue firmly planted in cheek

Just say something

Say something
For G-d’s sake
Say something!
Somebody,
I wish that you would
If they don’t enjoy it
You’re misunderstood
Say something,
Say anything good

Say something frightful!
Surprising, delightful!
Make me squirm,
Make it gross
Make me smile,
Be morose

Speak a truth
Swear an oath
Make it real
Never lie
Make me hurt
Make me think
Make me feel
Make me cry

Say something immortal

Cast a spell that will open a portal
And take me away
Send me on vacation
To find inspiration
Because I have nothing to say
