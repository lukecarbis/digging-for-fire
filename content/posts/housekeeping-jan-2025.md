A little housekeeping post, with a few updates to the website.

First of all, if you're reading this in your RSS reader, **THANK YOU** for keeping the dream alive.

You might like to [click through](/posts/housekeeping-jan-2025) for this post, because I've made some small changes to the website.

<!--more-->

I've updated the header with some neat ASCII art, and I've been adding a little more detail to the About page.

I've also added an email subscription option, using the _excellent_ Buttondown. Let me tell you about [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com) (not a paid endorsement, just a recommendation).

So email newsletter software is largely terrible. I've tried MailChimp, Campaign Monitor, Brevo, even a native Mac app called Direct Mail. The story is the same â€“ polished brands, terrible software. Hard to use, full of bugs (especially Brevo), and clearly steered toward nabbing your sweet sweet monthly subscription.

Buttondown is a bit different. Firstly, it actually includes my niche feature request out of the box (automatically trigger a new email whenever I publish a new post), instead of having to jury-rig some Rube Goldberg Zapier stack.

Secondly, it's got _just the right amount_ of personality. I love that in software. It really has small-team vibes, in the very best way possible. The [developer behind this](https://jmduke.com) is clearly influenced by the likes of Jason Fried, Amy Hoy, and DHH (complete with homepage manifesto). It's so easy to use. Everything just landed under my fingers.

Also, [this](https://buttondown.com/climate), [this](https://buttondown.com/alternatives), [this](https://buttondown.com/open-source), and [this](https://docs.buttondown.com/introduction).

Lastly, I've been working on a new feature, to provide _yet another_ way of keeping up to date. I'm working on adding a Podcast, which will mostly just be me reading each post. But who knows, maybe I'll throw some bonus content in there too. I'm hoping to have that live by next week.

Thanks again for reading!
