I've been interacting with quite a lot of Americans, Europeans, and Brits the last few days. I've learned two new things about the USA, and for once, neither comes from my typical sarcastic, antagonistic disposition toward "the land of the free".

First, Americans share a common cultural temperament with Aussies, which is that they're not afraid to call bullshit. They're inclined to stand up for what's right. Of course, this can cause problems, especially when the definition of "right" is disputed. But on the whole, it's better than turning a blind eye to suffering and injustice under the auspices of manners and "mind your business".

Second, American cities are very unsafe places right now. Houselessness has reached unprecedented heights, drug addiction afflicts a large proportion of the population, crime is up, and law enforcement is often either overwhelmed or restrained by policy. 

This is all anecdotal, of course. I've gone from a place of gently teasing my boastful and confident American friends (call it Tall Poppy Syndrome), to genuinely feeling sorry, even worried, for them.

It could be good for G-d's own "city on a hill" to be knocked down a peg or two, but I hope they can sort their shit out soon!

Beautiful national parks, though.
