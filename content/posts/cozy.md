Today is the last day of the year. I’ve been reflecting a lot in the past week (this whole past year, really) about the lasting impact of my career. Heady stuff – you know – real “leave a dent in the world” sort of thing.

So, the big idea my whole career was really about promoting the Open Web.

My definition is:

> The Open Web is a network of websites, accessible from any browser over http. The word “Open” is redundant; it serves only to distinguish The Web from other closed systems, such as private networks or proprietary app stores.

However, at the end of 2024, it appears as though the Open Web is in decline. Taking its place are private social networks (TikTok, Instagram), and private messaging (WhatsApp, Messages, Telegram). Some websites have switched focus away from the browser and into an app, like YouTube and Facebook.

The Open Web, as we knew it in the “good old days” of Web 2.0, is quickly disappearing. There are a few last stand places like ecommerce and wikipedia, but people just don’t seem need websites like they used to.

Nowhere has the impact been more obvious than in blogging. Gone are the days of “the blogosphere” and “blogrolls”. The internet’s long-form content writers up and moved to Instagram and YouTube to become “creators” and “influencers”. Short-form “reels” content is the norm, and let’s face it, it’s mostly [brain rot](https://corp.oup.com/news/brain-rot-named-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024/).

What about business websites? More and more businesses are eschewing a custom website in favour of a Facebook + Google Maps listing. It’s easier, cheaper, and gets information to customers faster.

And just in case you still harboured any hope at all that the Open Web might yet make a comeback, AI [enshittification](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/woty-2024/) is coming for us all.

BUT

There is a trend which I find kind of exciting. Have you heard of the Cozy Web? It feels underground, which I like. It feels a little bit like the early days of IRC.

The Cozy Web is a bit more of an idea than it is an actual place you can go. It exists as
