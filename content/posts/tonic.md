Ugh. Facebook.

There's a lot of us out there. Those strange, backward people who refuse to use Facebook or Instagram. Ads? algorithms? influencers!? ick!

Unfortunately, those of us who prefer to stay signed-out of such social media platforms often find ourselves attempting to access a business Facebook page, or some Instagram post that a well-intentioned friend found amusing. In such cases, we're bombarded by nagging login prompts, blocking the content and barring our way.

As it says in the scriptures:

{{< quote author="Broverbs 21:19" >}}
Better to dwell in the wilderness than with a quarrelsome and nagging website.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote author="Broverbs 27:15" >}}
A nagging app is like the dripping of a leaky roof in a rainstorm.
{{< /quote >}}

So, I built a free Safari extension to help Facebook and Instagram find some chill.

**Tonic** hides all login popups and nags from Facebook and Instagram. It let's you see the content, without the pestering attempts to produce a new account sign-up.

Tonic is MacOS only for now. It's mostly working on iOS too (there's some lingering difficulty with getting Instagram to play nicely), so let me know if that would be useful to you.

If you find Tonic helpful, please share it on, and leave an App Store review.
