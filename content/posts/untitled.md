Out of sheer curiosity, I applied for a job that had a really interesting cross-over between Education and AI. I flubbed the interview. I felt very out of practice, but also, the CEO had very silicon valley vibes. She was operating at a way faster speed to me.

Come to think of it, people often say that I'm calm or relaxed. Do they mean it as a compliment? It only happens when I'm on work trips. I think it might be less to do with my personality, and more to do with the semi-rural beach town I come from.

I'm studying, and I'm behind. I've overcommitted. I have another commitment that ends in a few weeks which should help relax things to something more manageable.

I also have an iOS app that [I want to build](/posts/pita-devlog-2/). But I need to figuratively clear my desk first.

We're camping over pesach. Everyone we speak to says it's a great idea, and I agree. We've shut up the house, chametz and all, and taken off on a road trip in the caravan. Our first few nights were in Mooloolaba, to be close to the community seders. It was really nice waking up to an ocean sunrise each morning with Zohar. After that we aimed west, and found a beautiful free camp just outside Dalby. The kids had a blast swimming in the creek.

Tonight we're parked up at Girraween National Park. It's jaw-droppingly pretty here.

But! Work to do. Assignments to complete. Blogs to distract me from actually being productive.

Travelling in the caravan gives me strong "keeping up with the Joneses" syndrome. Especially caravan parks, where rich city folk show off their fancy setups. I know it's unhealthy, but it's hard to suppress. Especially as a few small things on our caravan begin to need repair. We've had her about two years now.

Talia's pesach cooking is unrivalled, even with camp-kitchen limitations! Her matzah-crack is the most moorish thing I know. Aptly named.

After hiking Girraween tomorrow we'll head back to the coast, in the direction of Mullumbimby. Excited to see family there, and spend the last days of pesach in services with the community.
