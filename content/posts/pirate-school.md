Welcome to [Pirate School](https://pirateschool.fm)! A new podcast hosted by me and Talia Carbis, about the chaotic, messy, wild world of home education.

This podcast is basically just a chat about how we homeschool. We're both trained as teachers, so we do know a lot of those foundational education principles. And, of course, we have opinions.

We just released episode 9, which you can find on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/pirate-school/id1794742428), or wherever you get your podcasts. I've appended a short sample of the show to the end of the audio version of this post.

Quick sidebar on how we record:

We've tried a few different approaches, including separate lapel mics, and speaking together into a condenser mic (with a splitter cable for headphone foldback). What we settled on was simply sitting on the couch and speaking directly into our iPhones! We open Voice Memos, clap (to sync the two separate recordings in post), and begin.

The audio quality is nothing short of terrible. So to compensate, I simply combine and sync the audio files in Garageband, then upload the result to [Auphonic](http://auphonic.com). I'm no audiophile, but I don't think you can tell much of a difference between episodes we recorded with a fancy condenser mic in a baffled recording booth, and the iPhone microphone in the lounge room.
