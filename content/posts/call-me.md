Inspired by Matt Webb's [Unoffice Hours](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/24/unoffice_hours), I've opened by calendar for 30 minutes every week. Whether you'd like to chat about a recent blog post, how I organise, homeschooling, podcasting, film recommendations, or anything else, I'm available.

All you need to do is [book a call](http://zeeg.me/saadia/call).

You will need to be contactable via **FaceTime**. When you book the meeting, you will be given a FaceTime link to join the call. This should work everywhere, including non-Apple platforms via the web.

I'm on **Brisbane time** (GMT +10) so please check the times work for your own timezone

If you can't make it: please cancel the meeting or drop me an email. Running late happens and that's fine! I'll stay on the call for 5 mins.
