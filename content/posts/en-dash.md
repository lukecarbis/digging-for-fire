**Very important announcement.**

I've been using the em dash wrong. On this blog, ranges will now be correctly represented by an en dash. 0–9, 1987–2025, א–ת.

Additionally, I'd like to invite readers to join me in adopting the Guardian / Economist style of using spaced en dashes for asides – just like this.

Of course, I'm predisposed to a more British format. But the reason **you** should consider switching styles is because the un-spaced em dash aside has become a classic telltale marker of AI generated writing.

Standout from the crowd! Make a political statement! Support human creativity! Use an en dash!

While we're on the topic of punctuation, I'm very excited about 2026 being the year of the ellipsis! The unicode character "U+2026" is the [Horizontal Ellipsis](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2026), and it's one of my favourite characters. This will replace the pitiful U+2025 incumbent – the so-called "two dot leader" (‥).

Did you know that you can type an ellipsis using the Option+; shortcut? Try it out! No more three-character "dot dot dot". Just think of the storage efficiency!
