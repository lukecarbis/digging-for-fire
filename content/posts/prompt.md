I believe AI is a [multiplier](/posts/multiplier). AI tools multiply:

- The quality of the work
- The speed at which the work can be done
- The competency of the operator

But! You can only pick two.

### Speed + Quality

If you are already very competent at producing the work on your own, you can leverage AI to increase the speed of your work while maintaining a high standard of quality. It won't make you any better at what you do, but it will reduce the time you spend doing it.

### Speed + Competency

You can use AI to quickly spin up a prototype version of the work. The results will be messy, but if you pay attention you might just pick up a thing or two about how the work gets done.

### Quality + Competency

You can add AI steps to your workflow that will increase the quality of your work. You can learn from what the AI produces so that, in time, you'll get better at producing the work yourself.

Your choice will be reflected in your prompt.

For **Speed + Quality** use "for me" language. Command an action, usually a [starting point](/posts/starting-point/) request. This sounds like:
> Scaffold a [work].
> Suggest an outline for [work].
> Setup a boilerplate [work].

For **Speed + Competency** use "together" language. Ask for a complete solution, along with the explanation. This sounds like:
> Let's create a [work] together, step by step.
> How can we fix [work]?
> What's the best way for us to create a [work]?

For **Quality + Competency** use "my" language. Ask for suggested edits or changes, explicitly requesting them as dot points. This sounds like:
> Does my [work] match the requirements?
> Suggest changes to my [work].
> How could I improve my [work]?

Consider carefully the kind of work you're creating, and why you're creating it. Are you trying to become a better writer? coder? thinker? Maybe you're just trying to quickly prove an idea, or hoping to get the work done faster. Once you know, choose an approach, and prompt accordingly.
