In the early days of the cigarette, smoking was considered a harmless or even beneficial activity. Cigarettes were considered stylish, sophisticated, and doctor-approved. By the early 20th century, smoking was so deeply embedded in modern culture that it was hard to imagine a future without it!

Of course, fast-forward to now and, at least in Australia, cigarettes are heavily taxed, not permitted to advertise, or even be displayed in a store. Cigarette packets are covered in grotesque imagery intended to discourage their use. Smoking in bars and restaurants is not permitted, nor is smoking within 10m of a store, beach, or playground. In New Zealand, cigarettes are now banned entirely for anyone born after 1 January 2009!

We're all physically healthier for it.

But a new health crisis has taken the place of Big Tobacco. A mental health crisis.

The mental health of young Australians is plummeting dramatically, reflecting a world wide trend. All evidence points directly to Big Social.

{{< quote author="The Medical Journal of Australia" title="Mental health of young Australians" link="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.5694/mja2.52047" >}}
Yet despite this worldwide megatrend, public and media discourse is muffled. Health and social care systems remain asymmetrically focused on physical illness and disability. Despite the erosive effect of mental illness, public pressure and, consequently, the political will for a response, in proportion to the scale and urgency of the crisis, are yet to materialise.

The answers are likely to involve a blend of socio-economic and generational changes, rising adversity and inequality, and unforeseen consequences of technological advances. The US Surgeon General, drawing in part on the research and advocacy of Jean Twenge, has identified social media as a key megatrend undermining the mental health of young people.

**Why is nobody talking about this!?**

Social Media is the new cigarette. Our teenagers inhale TikTok and Instagram night and day, and millennial parents are no better. We are, collectively speaking, *hooked*. Social media addiction inflicts stress, aggression, anxiety, depression, interrupted sleep, and more, but nobody seems willing to do anything about it. 

Sorry if I sound to you like an angry vegan raging at an abattoir, but I've managed to wean myself off all forms of social media, and I promise you I'm better off for it. For me, this manifests as calmness and patience, but also a sort of down-time productivity that's resulted in a 1,000 day Duolingo streak and regular piano practice.

Lots of people find inspiration and community in social media spaces. But inspiration is nothing without creative action – and it strikes more readily with regular practice. You can [create your own social spaces amongst friends](/posts/cozy) in environments that aren't littered with ads and algorithmic feeds designed to hypnotise and enrapture.

Why not try a detox period? Keep a log of how you feel (like breaking any addiction, you can expect a difficult period to begin with). It's time to recognise that, like smoking, social media carries health risks that warrant our attention. It's time to take a proactive step to manage your digital consumption. It will make you happier and healthier.
