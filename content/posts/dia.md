I tried Dia. It's a new browser from the Browser Company that's all about AI-assisted browsing.

Verdict: Hard no.

First up, this was the first time I've ever experienced a sign-up form that refused to accept an iCloud address. Rude.

Second, I just can't switch to a browser that misses all the native integrations which Safari enjoys. I can't touch my fingerprint to my keyboard to sign-in, or handoff to my phone, or auto-fill from Apple Passwords, use Apple Pay, that sort of thing.

Last, it's not clear what this browser adds on top of the ChatGPT for Mac app. I've already got Option+Space ready to invoke ChatGPT _everywhere_ on my computer. If I need a YouTube video summarised, or a web search, or some code… ChatGPT is already available to me when and _where_ I need it. I don't need a specialised web browser for this.

There must be a type of person who uses the browser for everything, from word processing to entertainment to email. I don't. I use apps like Pages, Apple TV (or the excellent [Play](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190) by Marcos Tanaka), or Mail. I read my favourite websites through an RSS reader app. Going through my [App Defaults](/posts/defaults-2025/), the only thing I use the browser for is [Search](https://kagi.com), and [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com).

You know, while writing that previous sentence, I just wondered to myself: _does Auphonic have a Mac app?_[^1] My first inclination is to invoke ChatGPT right here in my Nova editor (where I'm writing this post) and ask. Opening a browser, navigating to the Auphonic website, and asking the Dia browser AI… it's just so many extra steps.

[^1]: No.
