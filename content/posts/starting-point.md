I [recently wrote](/posts/malleable-software) about the way AI is making it possible to build software _essentially_ for free. That's not exactly true – at least not yet.

Starting work on a new project is hard. It's the classic blank page problem. While AI doesn't yet do such a great job of programming, one thing that it's great at is giving me a starting point.

From there, it's much easier for me to say "that sucks, it should be done this way instead", and rewrite the whole thing.

I was chatting with a friend of mine, [Aaron West](https://www.linkedin.com/in/westaj/), about this phenomenon just now, while he worked on fixing a whole bunch of poorly generated React components. He put it this way:

> The *review and edit* workflow is much easier than building everything from scratch. Even if it means you end up rewriting the whole thing.

I've found this to also be true for writing. Occasionally I might ask ChatGPT to write something for me, only to find that the attempt inspires me in *what not to do*. I'll read it, abandon it, and feverishly begin my attempt to show the LLM how a real person does it.

Take that, ChatGPT.

I don't ever take that approach with this blog, since I only write what I'm inspired to write. I do occasionally prompt with "this paragraph doesn't quite work, can you fix it?" or "finish this thought…". Even then, I take the suggestions and run with something entirely different.

AI hasn't yet proven itself as a great writer or programmer, but it's an excellent tool for getting the creative ball rolling.
