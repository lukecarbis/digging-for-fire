When was the last time you were offline?

Like, really offline. Not just signed out of Slack. Not _Do Not Disturb_. Not even airplane mode. I'm talking phone entirely off for a good 24 hours. Stay at home, with no internet, and no screens.

It's a forcing function for your mental health.

I challenge you to try it. Once a week, or once a month, or once a year. Some sort of schedule helps set the right expectations with friends and family.

Just think of all the things you could do with 24 hours of screen-free time.

- Write a letter
- Read a book
- Take a nap
- Play some music
- Write a song
- Do yoga
- Write a poem
- Memorise something
- Take a nap
- Draw a bath
- Make a cocktail
- Think deeply
- Journal
- Go for a walk
- Talk to your neighbours
- Bake a cake
- Light a candle
- Meditate
- Take a nap
- Play some boardgames
- Be intimate with your partner
- Paint
- Savour the flavour in a glass of wine
- Play hide and seek with your kids
- Spend time in the garden
- Take a nap
- Birdwatch
- Listen to a record all the way through
- Stargaze
- Sketch
- Swim
- Stretch!
- Cook a fancy date-night dinner
- Totem tennis
- Origami
- Practice a magic trick
- Sew
- Upcycle (DI-Why?)
- Roast marshmallows over a fire
- Dream up some travel plans
- Go backyard camping
- Take a nap

No news. No plans. No chores. Just time at home, dedicated especially to **you**.
