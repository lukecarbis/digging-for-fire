I've been reading John Gruber's work since I was in high school. I've listened to every [Dithering](https://dithering.fm) episode to date. I once started a blog about inspired by Daring Fireball (it petered out, as blogs sometimes do).

And for the past five years, I've been recording Crossword with Jonathan Wold. It's a podcast about WordPress and the Open Web, with 15-minute (Dithering inspired) episodes.

We recently talked with John in a [guest episode of Crossword](https://crossword.fm/s09/e13/), and he was kind enough to link to our show from [his blog](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/10/yours-truly-on-crossword).

It's been a bit of a viral moment for us! My mind is a little blown that I am – right now – writing about my conversation with the creator of Markdown _in Markdown_.

That's one of the topics we cover in the episode, along with Substack, RSS, browsers, the open web, and where WordPress missed a trick.

Gruber joins the list of Open Web A-Listers we've spoken to on Crossword, including [Aaron Gustafson](https://crossword.fm/s04/e07/), [Peter Saint-Andre](https://crossword.fm/s02/e16/), and [Ryan Singer](https://crossword.fm/s02/e10/).

I'm marking this one down as a career highlight. Huge thanks to [Jonathan](http://jonathanwold.com) for his hard work editing the audio and transcript.
