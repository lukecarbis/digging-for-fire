I started out the year (or rather, [finished last year](/posts/peacock-resolutions)) with the goal of writing, and publishing, regularly.

I have been writing. A lot! Publishing, less so.

I've recently dropped some big commitments that will allow me a little more time to write and reflect on this blog a little more often.

I'm going to experiment with taking a break from adding audio episodes to each post. You can continue to catch me on [Async](https://async.fm), [Crossword](https://crossword.fm), and [Pirate School](https://pirateschool.fm).
