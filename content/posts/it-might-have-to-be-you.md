When something doesn’t work the way you’d like, what’s your first inclination?

Scrap it and look for a better one?

Or, are you the kind of person who would rather build it again from scratch? You’re a founder. A maker. A hacker. A smith.

We are founders. We learn lessons the hard way. We don’t easily take advice, but we often to surround ourselves with subject matter experts and develop deep relational trust. You can recognise us by our wake of failed-to-launch projects, and inability to keep to a schedule.

We are hackers. You’ll often find us in startup, open-source, and home education communities. We love to contribute. We imagine a better way, then we build it. Maybe it’s an accessibility feature, or maybe it’s a personalised syllabus. We embrace do-ocracy. 

We are makers. We can’t help but build and build and build. We embrace self-publishing, because we can’t stand editorial gatekeeping. Our works and talents have an indelible urge to exist in the public domain. We publish prolifically, blog posts, podcasts, resources, methodologies, code pushed to production.

So, if something doesn’t work the way you’d like, what are you going to do about it? Who’s going to change, build, invent it?

It might have to be you.
